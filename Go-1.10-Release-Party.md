title: Go-1.10-Release-Party
---

### What's happening?
To celebrate the release of Go 1.10 we're to organising a world wide release party during the month of February 2018 ðŸŽ‰ 

#### So what is the release date?
Go 1.10 was released on February 16.

### Sounds awesome, how can you get involved?
- If you host a Go user group or meetup, schedule a meetup during February, and celebrate with Gophers around the world.
- If you're a member of a Go user group or meetup, pester your organiser and let them know you'd like to participate.

After the event post a photo, make a video, write a blog post, scribble on your Facebook wall, or tweet something pithy. Let's see how big we can make the celebration.

Spread the word using hashtag [#GoReleaseParty](https://twitter.com/hashtag/goreleaseparty)

Don't forget to add your meetup's details :point_down: right here.

### Stay in touch

Trying to co-ordinate dozens of meetup groups around the globe will be challenging. Here are some ways you can plan your event, and keep up to date. 

As always, if you get stuck, or need help, please [contact the organisers directly](#no-seriously-whos-organising-this), we're here to help.
.
##### Slack Channel
We have a channel for the [release party](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/go-release-party/) on the [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/go-release-party/). If you need an invite to Slack, [you can request an automatic invite with this link](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/).

##### Mailing list
We have set up a [mailing list for meetup organisers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-meetup-organisers) to ask questions.

### What happens in a release party?
As with the previous [Go 1.6](/wiki/Go-1.6-release-party) and [Go 1.8](/wiki/Go-1.8-Release-Party) release parties, this is a great opportunity to spread the word about the improvements landing 1.10, and the plans for what is coming next!

#### Resources

You can use the slide deck that the Go London User Group in London will use. It's [available here](https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/dlsniper/talks/2018/go-1.10-release-party/presentation.slide#1) ([source](https://github.com/dlsniper/talks/tree/master/2018/go-1.10-release-party))

### What'll happen if Go 1.10 isn't out during February?
If all else fails... at least we'll have each other. 


### Who's organising this?
Well, if you run a Go meetup, you are. It can't be a worldwide release party without meetups around the globe.
